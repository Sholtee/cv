    "text": "It was not by chance that I became a programmer. I was just 10 when I got my very first computer (an Intel i386 based PC) and I immediately fell in love with it. Unfortunately, those days (in the middle of 90’s), there were no IT lessons at elementary schools, or even if there were, they were not very effective - so for a few years computer science remained just a hobby for me. But times changed. After leaving primary school, I was admitted to a high school where there was an IT faculty. There, I got acquainted with Pascal (which explains why I’m still a hobby Delphi programmer) and with the basics of programming. It was obvious by then that after the Matura exam I would continue my studies in this field. So I applied for the University of Pécs (PTE) and graduated there as a Software Information Technologist.<br><br>I started my career as an IT operator here in Pécs. My first job was at the local court, but it didn’t last long. Half a year later I moved to Budapest where I contracted to a small company specialized in developing education supporting systems. During the three and a half years I spent there, I dug deeper in the back-end programming (mainly in C#) and I experienced how our education system works “under the hood”. In 2016 - because of this experience - I had the opportunity to move on, so I changed my workplace and started to work for the Education Authority (former Ministry of Education). At the beginning I was just a back-end developer (C# & NodeJS) but soon – because of the lack of UI designers, I had to learn front-end development as well. I started with AngularJS, then I switched to VueJS which is still my favorite UI framework. I moved back to my hometown in 2017 so I could get used to remote work before the pandemic. In the recent years I'm working for Sophos (an international cybersecurity company) as a full-stack developer making back-end and front-end solutions backed by AWS infrastructure.<br><br>I’m a passionate developer. In my free time I learn about programming and maintain some open-source projects. Besides it, I honestly believe in “healthy soul in healthy body”. That’s why running and doing workouts are everyday activities for me. I’m proud to have been the organizer of the weekly running competition at my previous workplace."
